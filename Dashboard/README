Tool used: Tableau (interactive web dashboard)

Goal

Communicate key findings from the cleaned + API-enriched dataset and show how they inform decisions.

Data used (inputs)

Cleaned base: standardized headers/types, fixed missing values, split multi-country cells, removed “Unknown/US” where out of scope.

API enrichment: country-level Population and Internet % joined to the dataset.

What’s in the dashboard

Map – Workshops by Country.

Color by Workshops.

Table/Bar – Workshops by Income Level & Country

Treemap – Category Mix

Interactions: global filters (Country, Date, Category, Income Level). Selecting a tier highlights countries on the map.

Key insights (example findings)

Geographic concentration: A few LATAM markets contribute most workshops (e.g., Colombia, Perú, México, El Salvador).

Income-tier balance: Upper-middle-income countries dominate volume; per-capita view surfaces under-served lower-income markets.

Category mix: A small set of categories (e.g., Educación) account for the majority of events.

Decisions this can inform

Market prioritization: Double-down on proven countries; pilot in low-served but strategic markets (identified by per-capita gap and Internet %).

Equity & access: Set targets/OKRs for lower-income tiers; adjust pricing/scholarships accordingly.

Content roadmap: Scale top categories across similar countries; prune or redesign low-impact themes.

Operational planning: Allocate trainers/partners and travel around hubs; cluster nearby countries to reduce cost.
